So this is the prototype for a game idea that a friend suggested, which he called "Pixel Craft" If I can remember correctly…

The objective of the game is to get the square to the trophy, you can move the square around using the arrow keys (left and right arrows). You will notice that there is a huge pit, well you need to collect some pixels from the enemy that is currently in front of you. If you touch him you will begin to collect a bunch of pixels… Then use the mouse to click over the pit and create a bridge using the Pixels to form a bridge for the square to move over.
